        For the past decade, I've been a professional badminton player. 
        While I'm semi-retired now, I still occasionally compete in tournaments. Hopefully I can resume my career once I graduate!</p>

        <p>When I'm not practicing badminton, I like to play video games and hang out with my friends. <br>
